/*
    we'll understand the fundamental principles of the language

        we'll talk about things that underlie the way that the language works:
            execution context
            lexical environment
            scope chain
            hoisting
            function invocation
            function scope vs block scope
            dynamic vs lexical scope
            this - call, apply, bind
            IIFE
