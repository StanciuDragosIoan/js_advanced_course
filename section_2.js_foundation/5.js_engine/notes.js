        ### JS Engine

        -js is a single-threaded language that uses a callback queue
        -js is an interpreted language

        -JS engine 'translates the code' for the computer

        -there are multiple JS engines (V8 used by chrome and node) + other: chakra, spiderm onkey, etc...

        -google released V8 in 2008 (their google maps needed a powerful engine to render the full features
          of the google maps)

            #the engine reads the code and understands it
