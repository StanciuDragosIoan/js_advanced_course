/*
    why not use machine code from the beginning? why don't all programs just use machine
    code ahead of time (we compile it and jsut give the machine code to the browser)


    if JS were compiled, either the compillation would have to be super fast (as JS is
    sent from the server to the browser so the compiling has to happen in the browser) or the
    browsers would have to agree on some common bynary standard for the machine code

    when JS was created in 1995, browsers started to be (browsers were competing against eachother)
    so compiling the code in the browser was not feasible (as it was slow) + having all the browsers agree
    on a common executable format was impossible (as browsers were competing)

    web assembly would be a common standard in the future (a standard bynary executable format)
        we didn't have this in 1995 (browsers could not agree upon a format)

    now we can compile our code to web assembly so that it runs fast on the browser
