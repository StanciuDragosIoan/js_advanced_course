/*
    js engine instructs the computer to execute the JS code


    JS code is initially broken into tokens (by the parser)

    next code is converted into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) --> see https://astexplorer.net/

    once it became an AST, the code runs through an interpreter (compiler/profiler) which spits out bytecode -
        code that CPU can understand and run
