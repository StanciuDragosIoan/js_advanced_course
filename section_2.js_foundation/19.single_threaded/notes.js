/*
    JS is single-threaded = only 1 set of instructions is being executed at a time

    Single threaded languages are having a single stack

    Initially the language was used only for basic page interaction so the single threaded
    paradygm was fit for that

    the JS engine makes  the JS code to run synchronously
