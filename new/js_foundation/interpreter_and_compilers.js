/*

interpreter = translates and reads the files line by line on the fly
interpreters are quick to set up and run (much faster than a compiler)

compiler = compiles code into lower lvl code (like machine code)
compilers are slower to set up but they optimize the execution (for instance inside of a loop)



a combination of an interpreter and a compiler = JIT compiler

JIT (just in time) compiler
