/*

Lexical environment = where we write our code 

Each function has its own lexical environment 
(some are in global execution context,
others are inside other function's scope)

in JavaScript our #lexicalScope (available data + variables
where the function was defined) determines our available variables.
Not where the function is called (that's called #dynamicScope)
